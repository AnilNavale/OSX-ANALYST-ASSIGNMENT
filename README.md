# OSX-ANALYST-ASSIGNMENT
#Context
● Imagine you are working as a Data Analyst for a Police Department.
● The Police Captain would like to perform a detailed analysis of the crime committed in
your jurisdiction in the year 2016 (Yes !! the data is old since the police department is still
catching up with digitalization).
● The idea is to extract actionable insights from the analysis for improving the
overall safety of the city by learning from past experiences.
● The problem statement is open-ended by design. The captain is not aware of the
pre-existing patterns and trends that are to be uncovered through the dataset. He is
relying on you to unearth interesting insights. So be creative. The safety of your city
depends on you !!!
What is Expected ?
● As mentioned in the “Context” section, the scope of the problem statement is fairly open.
● Use the weapon of your choice (R, Python, etc) to get the job done.
● Submit a word/pdf document highlighting the actionable insights from the analysis. Feel
free to add code snippets wherever necessary.
● Clearly state the assumptions made (if any).
● Submit the source code used for building models in a zip or share the link to the GitHub
repository.
